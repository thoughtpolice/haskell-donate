    <h1>Make a donation to Haskell.org</h1>

    <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>

    <p>On this page, you can make an instant donation
    to <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell.org</a> -- using any credit
    card, debit card, or <a href="https://www.bitcoin.org">Bitcoin</a>.</p>

    <p>Haskell.org is a ยง501(c)3 organization, registered in the state of New
    York. This means your donations are <strong>tax deductable</strong>,
    allowing you to deduct your donated amount from your state's income
    tax! <em>(What is a ยง501(c)3 exactly, you
    ask? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization#501.28c.29.283.29">Wikipedia
    has you covered</a>.)</em></p>

    <p>Security and privacy is taken seriously for donations. For more
    information about this, see the <a href="/security.html">security page</a>,
    which details what happens when you donate.</p>

    <h3>Donate with Stripe</h3>

    <p>To donate to Haskell.org immediately, the preferred method is to
    use <a href="https://www.stripe.com">Stripe</a> with our online form. This
    is easy, convenient, and should work in any modern browser (on mobile, or
    desktop).</p>

    <p>Stripe supports credit and debit cards, as well as Bitcoin. We
    even support

    <h3>Alternative: Donate with Click & Pledge</h3>

    <p>If for some reason the above form doesn't work for you, you can also
    donate to Haskell.org using <a href="https://www.clickandpledge.com">Click &
    Pledge</a>.</p>

    <p>When you use Click & Pledge, your funds are granted to Haskell.org on
    behalf of <a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in the Public
    Interest</a> (SPI), a non-profit ยง501(c)3 registered in the state of New
    York. (<strong>Note:</strong> Haskell.org was under SPI for many years, but
    in 2016 was granted its own independent ยง501(c)3 status. When you make a
    donation via Click & Pledge, it goes via SPI indirectly to us.)</p>
