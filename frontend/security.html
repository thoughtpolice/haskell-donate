    <h1>Security and privacy</h1>

    <p>Security and privacy are taken seriously when
    using <a href="/donate.html">the donation form</a>. Donations rely
    on almost no outside services, and can be made (for the most part)
    completely anonymously. Here you can find some notes and common
    points addressing some questions you might have.</p>

    <h3>Source code</h3>

    <p>The source to this service
    is <a href="https://github.com/thoughtpolice/haskell-donate">available
    on GitHub</a>.</p>

    <hr/>

    <p>Your credit card details are never stored in any way, on any
    server we run. Your credit card details will never leave your
    browser. We use a temporary, one-time-use token that is generated
    in your browser, and
    have <a href="https://www.stripe.com">Stripe</a> debit your
    account using that token.</p>

    <p>The only identifiable information we have is the information
    you leave in the submission form, namely, your name and email
    address. This email address is ONLY used to send email receipts to
    you, and so we can do basic accounting of the donations. If
    multiple donations come from the same email address, the donation
    service recognizes these, and groups these together under one
    donor. This is the only aggregation or accounting that is
    done.</p>

    <p>Email addresses are ONLY used for receipts, and for basic donor
    accounting. Receipts DO NOT contain any truly confidential
    information, they are for accounting purposes; you may use
    throw-away or burner email addresses.</p>

    <hr/>

    <p>This site is ONLY served over
    HTTPS. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">Strict-Transport-Security</a>
    is enabled. HTTP/2 is enabled. SSL certificates
    use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm">ECDSA</a>
    signatures, with ECDHE as the key exchange mechanism. Certificates are
    signed and generated by <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>,
    once every 30 days. SSL cipher suites are generally strong, including
    perfect-forward secrecy (e.g. AES-GCM or ChaCha20/Poly1305). No external
    services besides <a href="https://www.stripe.com">Stripe</a> are used.</p>

    <p>There is no true persistent database behind this application;
    the only record of donations and donors is maintained by
    <a href="https://www.stripe.com">Stripe</a> internally.</p>

    <p>You <strong>must</strong> have JavaScript enabled on this domain in order
    to donate.</p>

    <hr/>

    <p>There is (generally) no attempt to
    block or otherwise curb traffic from systems such
    as <a href="https://www.tor-project.org">Tor</a>. When combined
    with Bitcoin, and a throw away email, this gives you a decent
    level of anonymity and shielding.</p>

    <p>There are no CDNs of any kind (such
    as <a href="https://www.fastly.com">Fastly</a>
    or <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>) used for
    this domain. The only files served from outside our domain are
    integrations with <a href="https://www.stripe.com">Stripe</a>.</p>

    <p>There are no third party JavaScript libraries used in this page
    other than Stripe.js and Checkout.js, and there is very minimal
    amounts of code in the donation server, in order to keep the
    codebase small, and have maximum auditability.</p>

    <p>While <em>we</em> do not have any tracking, or use any 3rd
    party tracking services on this
    page, <a href="https://www.stripe.com">Stripe</a>, by way of their
    JavaScript code, does use trackers
    like <a href="https://mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a>. Stripe doesn't
    support external usage of its JavaScript libraries at this time
    without these services. Thus, while we have no skin in the game
    &mdash; so to speak &mdash; the donation form as it exists today
      does have minor amounts of analytics/tracking.</p>
